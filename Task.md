# Description

Build a lightweight Python script that gathers recent public news headlines on one stock or crypto, uses a simple AI or sentiment library to classify each headline as bullish, neutral, or bearish, and then stores the results in a CSV. Produce a short text summary that highlights any patterns (e.g., spikes in bullish or bearish sentiment) over the past 7â€“10 days. This respects your coding skills, provides tangible insights for your future trades, and remains free of marketing or events you do not plan to attend
